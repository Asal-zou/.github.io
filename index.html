            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a Biomedical Engineering graduate, my academic journey 
has been driven by a profound fascination with the intersection of 
computer science and data analytics in the realm of medical imaging. My 
thesis on data analytics and my role as a Research and Development 
Assistant at a startup have been pivotal experiences that solidified my 
interest in this field.</p>
            <p>Starting my academic journey at Aachen University of 
Applied Sciences, I went beyond theoretical learning, gaining practical 
training in diverse areas. Each semester brought specific practical 
training within each course, like imaging and signal processing, 
introducing me to Doppler sonography and ultrasound techniques. My studies 
in general biomedical engineering equipped me with a comprehensive 
understanding of industry facets and academic possibilities.</p>
            <p>In the final one and half years of my studies, I dedicated 
myself to an in-depth bachelor's thesis, inspired by the captivating 
experience of exploring research methodologies across different courses. A 
few months after completing my studies, I had the privilege of publishing 
and presenting my thesis, titled 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of different 
anti-VEGF inhibitors as a treatment for neovascular age-related macular 
degeneration using Markov modeling,' at the DOG Congress.</p>
            <p>Motivated by my experience in research and a passion for 
continuous learning, I joined E-Rain Corp., a startup committed to 
Innovation and Product Development. This real-world exposure provided 
insights into the inception of inventions and allowed me to gain hands-on 
knowledge in conducting market research. In this dynamic environment, I 
learned the intricacies of transforming innovative ideas into tangible 
products, deepening my understanding of computer programming and inspiring 
me to pursue further academic studies.</p>
